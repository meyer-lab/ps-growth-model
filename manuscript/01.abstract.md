## Abstract {.page_break_before}

Cancer cell sensitivity or resistance is almost universally quantified through a direct or surrogate measure of cell number over time. However, compound responses can occur through a number of distinct phenotypic outcomes, including changes in cell growth, apoptosis, and non-apoptotic cell death. These outcomes have distinct effects on the tumor microenvironment, immune response, and capacity for resistance development. Here, we show that quantifying cell viability alone is insufficient to distinguish between these compound responses. Using an alternative assay and computational analysis amenable to high-throughput measurement, we find that compounds with identical viability outcomes have very different effects on cell growth and death when separated. Moreover, compound pairs with additive cell growth and death effects can appear synergistic when only assessed by viability. Overall, these results demonstrate an approach to incorporating measurements of cell death into pharmacologic response.
