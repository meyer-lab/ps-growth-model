## Methods

All analysis was implemented in Python, and can be found at https://github.com/meyer-lab/ps-growth-model, release 1.0 (doi: 00.0000/arc0000000).

### Compounds and Cell culture

Doxorubicine, OSI-906, BYL719, binimetinib, and paclitaxel were purchased from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA). PIM447 and LCL161 were obtained from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, TX). Vinorelbine was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). THZ1 was purchased from Cayman Chemical Company (Ann Arbor, MI). Human lung carcinoma PC9 cells were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, and H1299 cells were provided from ATCC (Manassas, VA). All cell lines were grown in RMPI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, at 37℃ and 5% CO~2~.

### End-point cell viability assay and time-lapse microscopy

For the end-point cell viability assay in Fig. 1, cells were seeded at 1.5 × 10^3^ cells per well in 96-well plates and cultured overnight. Then, cells were treated with doxorubicin. After 72 hrs, CellTiter Glo reagent (Promega, Madison, WI) was added to each well and luminescence was detected according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Cells were seeded as indicated above. The next day, each indicated treatment was added, along with IncuCyte Annexin V Green Reagent (Essen BioScience, Ann Arbor, MI) and 300 nM YOYO-3 in media containing 1.25 mM CaCl~2~. Cells were then cultured and imaged within the IncuCyte Zoom or S3 (Essen BioScience) every 3 hrs. Four fields of view were taken per well. Fluorescence images were manually thresholded and the fraction of image area with Annexin V and/or YOYO-3 signal was quantified using IncuCyte Zoom or S3 software (Essen BioScience). Finally, the fraction of area occupied by cells was analyzed by brightfield analysis.

### Hill curve identifiability model related to Fig. 1

A model of exponential growth along with death was fit to viability measurements assuming a Hill dose-response relationship. For comparing the model to the data, the fit residuals were assumed to be normally distributed. The growth rate was measured and experimentally set to be 0.0315 1/hr, and cells were assumed to not undergo cell death in the absence of drug. The minimum growth rate (at infinite concentration of drug) was fit using a uniform prior between 0.0 and the growth rate in the absence of drug. The maximal death rate (at infinite concentration of drug) was fit using a log-normal prior of -2.0 ± 2.0 1/hr (log~10~ scale). The Hill slope was fit using a log-normal prior of 0.0 ± 1.0 (log~10~ scale). Both the IC~50~ and Hill slope were assumed to be the same for growth and death rates.

### Growth model structure

Cell behavior was modeled using a series of kinetic equations incorporating cell growth and death. We represent the overall state of a population of cells as $v = \[L, E, D_a, D_n \]$, respectively indicating the number of live cells, cells within early apoptosis, dead cells via apoptosis, and dead cells via a non-apoptotic process. Using such notation, the time derivative was defined as:

$$\dot{v} = \[(R_g - R_d)L, R_d \cdot f \cdot L - E, \tau \cdot E, R_d (1-f) L \]$$

where $R_g$ (or `div`) is the rate of cell division, $R_d$ (or `deathRate`) is the rate of cell death, $f$ (or `apopFrac`) is the fraction of dying cells which go through apoptosis, and $\tau$ (or `d`) determines the rate of conversion from early to late apoptosis.

If $\gamma = R_g - R_d$, $c = (R_d \cdot f)/(g+d)$, and $m = R_d (1-f)$, integrating these equations provides the solution:

$$v(t) = \[ e^{\gamma t}, c(L-e^{mt}), mc(L-1)/\gamma + c(e^{mt}-1), m(L-1)/\gamma \]$$

### Growth model inferrence

Predicted cell numbers were fit to experimental measurements using Markov chain Monte Carlo [@doi:10.7717/peerj-cs.55]. The percent area positive for cell confluence, Annexin V stain, or YOYO-3 stain was quantified and assumed to be proportional to the number of cells positive for each marker. Cell confluence was assumed to be the total of cells in all states. Apoptotic cells were assumed to be positive for Annexin V signal then positive for both signals after late apoptosis. Non-apoptotic cells were assumed to just be positive for YOYO-3 signal after dying. Each rate parameter was fit to the corresponding measurements within a single drug condition over time. An entire experiment, corresponding to a set of different compounds and concentrations, was fit simultaneously, allowing for a background offset and conversion factor of each quantity to be fit across the experiment.

`div` was set to have a uniform prior of 0.0–0.35 1/hr.  `deathRate`, and `d` were set to have log-normal prior distributions of mean 0.01 1/hr with standard deviation 0.5 (log~10~ scale). By inspecting a calibration experiment and manually counting the cells within a field, we measured the conversion between number of cells and area of signal for the confluence, Annexin V, and YOYO-3 images. In addition, we quantified the ratio of positive area for each pair of signals when a single cell was positive for both. Each of these were set as log-normal prior distributions on the conversion values between number of cells and positive area. Finally, we observed appreciable background in the Annexin V and YOYO-3 signal, leading to signal in the absence of cells. Therefore, we set log-normal priors for the background levels with mean 0.1% of area and standard deviation of 0.1 (log~10~ scale). Each data point was assumed to have independent, normally-distributed error around the model prediction.

Sampling convergence was verified by checking that two independent runs generated insignificant differences, checking for ergodicity through the Geweke criterion comparing the first and second half of each run, and verifying an effective sample size of greater than 200. Sampling failures were solved by increasing the number of tuning samples.

### CFSE-based cell proliferation analysis

Cell division was measured using carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution analysis. Cells were labeled with 5 μM CFSE (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The stained cells were seeded overnight in 60 mm dishes at a density of 2 × 10^5^ cells per dish, and then treated with indicated drugs next day. For 72 hrs at 24 hr intervals, cells were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde prior to acquisition on a BD LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). CFSE signal intensity of 1 × 10^4^ cells was recorded and analyzed to measure cell divisions. The same cell line was labeled the day of the analysis to determine initial labeling.

### Western blot analysis

Cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 10^5^ cells per 60 mm dish 24 hrs prior to drug treatment then treated with the indicated conditions for 24, 48, and 72 hrs. After incubation, cells were lysed in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X 100, 0.1% Na deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 140 mM NaCl, freshly supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor (Boston Bio Products, Ashland, MA). Protein concentration was measured by a bicinchoninic acid assay. 10 μg of protein from each cell lysate was subjected to SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. Each membrane was incubated overnight with antibody against cleaved caspase 3 (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, #9664) or 1.5 hrs with HRP conjugated β-actin antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, #12262). β-actin was used as a loading control for western blot analysis.

### Drug interaction fitting

Drug interaction was assumed to follow the Bliss independence model [@pmid:7568331]. Where indicated, this was taken to be defined as a proportional decrease in the viability of cells. That is, cell viability was normalized to 1.0 for the control condition, and then the proportional decrease in cell viability was calculated by 1.0 minus cell viability. Synergy or antagonism was identified by a greater or lesser decrease in viability than predicted, respectively.

Alternatively, Bliss additivity was defined in conjunction with a model incorporating cell death. `d` and `apopfrac` were assumed to be constant across drug concentration or combination and fit using the same prior as before. The growth rate in the absence of drug was fit using the log-normal prior of -1.5 ± 0.1/hr (log~10~ scale) based on experimental growth measurement. Cells were assumed to undergo no cell death in the absence of drug. An $E_{max}$ of growth inhibition was fit using a Beta prior (ɑ = 1.0, β = 1.0), where 1.0 indicates complete growth inhibition and 0.0 no growth inhibition. The $E_{max}$ of death effect was fit using a lognormal prior of -2.0 ± 0.5/hr (log~10~ scale) where the value indicates the maximal death rate. The half-maximal concentration ($EC_{50}$ or $IC_{50}$) and Hill coefficient of each compound were fit using the same priors as before for these quantities and assumed to be the same for both growth and death effects.
