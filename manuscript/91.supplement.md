## Supplementary Figures {.page_break_before}

![**Endpoint measurements provide similar results to those with kinetic measurements.**
Violin plots indicate the model posterior after fitting.

![**Drug response measurements for a panel of targeted agents.**
Model fits are shown in fig. {@fig:S3}, and results are summarized in fig. {@fig:targeted}.
Each line represents the mean of triplicate measurements for individual drug dose over time and shaded areas show the range of the measurements.

![**Model fitting to the drug response panel in fig. {@fig:S2}.**
Violin plots indicate the model posterior after fitting to each treatment's kinetic measurements.

![**Drug response measurements for combinations of two agents with divergent phenotypic responses.**
a, Drug response measurement of LCL161 combined with OSI-906.
b, Drug response measurement of PIM447 combined with OSI-906.
Each line represents the mean of triplicate measurements for individual drug dose over time and shaded areas show the ranges of measurements.
