Quantifying cellular response to therapeutic compounds is essential to understanding their mechanisms of action and assessing therapeutic efficacy [@pmid:22003129; @pmid:19451690; @pmid:22460902]. In the case of cancer treatments, and often with other diseases, drug activities are evaluated by quantifying the number of live cells after a short period using direct or surrogate measurements [@pmid:22886092; @pmid:24013279]. However, quantities beyond the number and viability of cells provide valuable information about the cellular response. Along with altering cell proliferation, promoting cell death is another important index of drug efficacy [@pmid:22959036; @pmid:22310284]. Incomplete eradication of drug-susceptible malignant cells allows the survival of drug-tolerant persister cell populations that can develop resistance by multiple routes [@pmid:20371346; @pmid:26828195; @pmid:26891683]. Moreover, cell death can occur via a variety of mechanisms, including apoptosis and necroptosis, and selection among these outcomes can potently modulate cancer immunogenicity [@pmid:28338065]. Limited understanding of these underlying cellular responses further complicates the assessment of drug combinations. Combination treatments are typically evaluated for their ability to enact greater effects than either compound alone [@pmid:26171228], but typically only by quantifying viability.

Here, we show that directly measuring both cell growth and death can provide valuable information for interpreting the response of cells to single and combination treatments. We propose a framework for quantifying drug response that accounts for the compound-induced changes in rates of cell growth and death. This approach reveals extensive differences in cell response otherwise hidden by simply quantifying cell number. Of course, trade-offs exist for the breadth versus depth of analysis that can be performed to characterize cell-compound response. We show that endpoint analysis preserves much of the distinct outcomes we observe for kinetic measurements while allowing similarly high-throughput analysis to those of live cell number surrogates. These results demonstrate the need for and an approach to more precisely quantify the nature of cell-compound response and interactions.
