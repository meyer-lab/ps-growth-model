With the notion that cell growth and death are confounded in live cell measurements (fig. {@fig:distinguish}a), we first characterized the potential variation in both that underlie drug response and may cause different outcomes. To do so, we used a typical dose-response measurement series of H1299 non-small cell lung cancer cells to a chemotherapy doxorubicin, a DNA intercalating agent (fig. {@fig:distinguish}b). We fit these measurements to a model incorporating both cell growth and death. To simplify this model, we assumed that there is no cell death in the absence of drug to show the best-case scenario of assessing drug response. This model  was identifiably parameterized with respect to the live cell number relationship (fig. {@fig:distinguish}c). The IC~50~ and E~max~ of compound effect on cell viability was narrowly defined as 21.40 ± 0.98 nM and 26.72 ± 3.37% (90% confidence interval), respectively, supporting the confident fitting of these metrics. In contrast, the model showed large uncertainty in both the cellular growth or death rates (fig. {@fig:distinguish}d,e). The efficacy of compound on growth and death rates varied largely, while the concentrations that inhibit 50% of growth rate or induce 50% of death rate remained consistent. At the maximum dose, the predicted growth rate ranged from 1.39 x 10^-2^ to 2.95 x 10^-2^ h^-1^ and death rate from 9.63 x 10^-4^ to 1.65 x 10^-2^ h^-1^ (90% confidence interval). The large uncertainty outcome was due to strong correlation in the fit values of drug effect on the growth and death rates (fig. {@fig:distinguish}f). This implies that, given only live cell values, one is incapable of distinguishing between reductions in cellular growth rate and increases in cell death. The uncertainty of these parameters can mask distinct cell responses to compounds. The number of divisions and dead cells can vary largely under similar drug response curve fitted according to live cell numbers. As shown in fig. {@fig:distinguish}g, when the ratio of growth to death effect increases, the number of cell divisions and dead cells decrease, suggesting potent inhibition of cell growth than inducing cell death. In contrast, the higher the cell death effect than cell growth inhibition, the ratio decreases. Moreover, the model predicts that the average cell divisions and cumulative dead cells can differ more than two-fold while resulting in the same drug response measurements. Recognizing this underlying variation of cell growth and death is important because it may indicate the distinct paths of cell evolution from drug treatments [@pmid:26828195; @pmid:26891683]. Therefore, distinguishing these variation can unmask meaningful differences in cell drug response and affect the interpretation of drug effects.

### High-throughput measurements of cell death quantify compound response

The model considers two fractions of cells in cell death: cells dying through apoptosis (apopfrac) and other modes (1 - apopfrac). apopfrac = 1, when all the cells die via apoptosis. In apopfrac, cells in early apoptosis (A) proceed into late apoptosis (DA) by losing membrane integrity at a rate (d). ‘1-apopfrac’ consist of cells in non-apoptotic death process (DN). The ordinary differential equations derived from the model are shown in the Methods.

With confidence that additional measurements would provide more detailed pharmacologic response quantitation, we extended our experimental measurements to incorporate measurements of cell death. While quantifying the number of cells over time by phase, we used an Annexin V probe to measure phosphatidylserine exposure during apoptosis [@pmid:20671723] and a membrane-impermeable DNA dye, YOYO-3, to measure permeabilized apoptotic and dead cells (fig. {@fig:measure}a and Supplementary Video 1-9). The areas occupied by cells, Annexin V and/or YOYO-3 signals in each image were then analyzed to determine the total cells, apoptotic and dead cells in percentage relative to the whole image area. We evaluated this real-time imaging method by measuring response to doxorubicin (DOX) in H1299 cells.  DOX strongly reduced the number of cells (fig. {@fig:measure}b, top), as seen before (fig. {@fig:distinguish}b). At the same time, we observed an increase in Annexin V while YOYO-3 increased minimally over the course of the assay. Fitting these data to a model of cell growth and death (fig. {@fig:measure}c), we observed a strong decrease in the inferred growth rate (div), only a modest increase in cell death rate (deathRate; fig. {@fig:measure}d, top). We next compared these measurements to those with another chemotherapy, vinorelbine (NVB), again observing a dose-dependent decrease in the number of live cells (fig. {@fig:measure}b, bottom). At the same time, we observed a large increase in both Annexin V and YOYO-3 signal. This was reflected in our subsequent analysis, inferring an increase in the death rate (fig. {@fig:measure}d, bottom). In addition, the fraction of cells dying through apoptosis (apopfrac) was predicted to be lower in NVB as compared to DOX treatment (fig. {@fig:measure}d). While kinetic measurements provide a wealth of information, end-point measurement is more amenable to high-throughput experiments. We confirmed that our analysis provided qualitatively similar results using just the first and last measurements in each experiment, supporting that kinetic measurements are optional for quantifying cell death (fig. {@fig:S1}).

To independently verify the opposing outcomes upon DOX or NVB treatment, we utilized a carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)-based proliferation assay to verify the distinct growth rate effects inferred by our analysis. We measured CFSE intensity of untreated cells every 24 hr starting from a day after cell-labelling (fig. {@fig:measure}e, left). The detected intensity over time was used to estimate the number of times each cell had divided. Consistent with the inferred growth rate of our model, DOX-treated cells distributed more towards higher CFSE intensity in dose-dependent manner, implying fewer cell divisions than with non-treated cells (fig. {@fig:measure}e, right). In contrast, the distribution of NVB-treated cells remained similar to non-treated cells. Our inferred cell growth rates and CFSE measurements were overall consistent (fig. {@fig:measure}f).

To validate the deduced cell death rates, we measured induction of cleaved caspase-3, an apoptotic marker, after treatment with DOX or NVB (fig. {@fig:measure}g). After 24-hr treatment, cleaved caspase-3 was detected in NVB- but not DOX-treated cells. Both drugs induced the caspase-3 cleavage by 48-hr treatment. These observations were consistent with the inferred cell death rates that NVB induces faster cell death than DOX. Interestingly, the level of cleaved caspase-3 after 72-hr treatment was lower in NVB-treated cells compared to DOX-treated cells. This may be explained by the dose-dependent decrease of apopfrac in NVB treatment while the cell death rates increased in fig. {@fig:measure}d, which implies the increase of non-apoptotic cell death, such as caspase-independent cell death. Phosphatidylserine is irreversibly externalized to the cell surface by caspase-dependent scramblases during apoptosis, in contrast, it is not exposed by caspase-independent cell death [@pmid:12920030; @pmid:26437594]. Although, further detailed investigation is needed, NVB may have induced caspase-independent cell death as well as apoptosis. Collectively, measuring and analyzing phase, Annexin V and YOYO-3 signals can quantify both the growth and death rate effects of drugs on cells.

We evaluated whether the growth-death model can dissect the response of cancer cells to targeted compounds as well. We treated a non-small cell lung cancer cell line PC9 with 6 different targeted drugs, whose effects on cell growth and death vary according to their mechanism of action. We also used paclitaxel, a chemotherapeutic drug that is widely known to interfere with cell cycle resulting in reduced proliferation and cell death, as a standard compound for comparing/assessing the impact of targeted drugs on cell division and death rate. The quantified signals for total, apoptotic and dead cell number from each compound treatment were diverse (fig. {@fig:S2}) and these differences were reflected to the inferred cell division and death rates (fig. {@fig:targeted} and fig. {@fig:S3}). We were able to classify the tested compounds into 3 types: a compound (1) inhibiting cell division and inducing cell death, (2) inhibiting only cell division, and (3) inducing only cell death. As expected, paclitaxel fell into the first type by simultaneously exhibiting strong cell growth suppression and death. Similar to paclitaxel, a PI3Kɑ inhibitor BYL749, a pan-PIM kinase inhibitor PIM447 and an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib were grouped into the first type.

Both OSI-906, a dual IGF1R and INSR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, and binimetinib, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, only decreased the cell division rates without any alteration in the cell death rate. OSI-906 inhibited the division rate as effective as paclitaxel within the range of tested doses. LCL161 is a small molecule SMAC mimetic that antagonize multiple inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family proteins and augments apoptosis induction. Consistent with its mechanism of action, LCL161 showed minimal effect on cell division while strongly enhanced cell death. Taken together, the proposed growth-death model allows us to interpret the response of cancer cells to different targeted drugs in terms of cell division and death rates, which otherwise would not be revealed from overall phenotypic changes without a series of experiments.
